# react-tc-dashboard
A very simple dashboard for TeamCity, built on React/Redux  
This is mainly a pet project I am using to learn react/redux. Obviously feedbacks are welcome :)

## Prerequisite
npm3 is needed to be able to build the project.
You also need TypeScript2:
  npm i typescript -g

Then at the root of the project you can try to install all dependencies:
  npm i

To launch tests, using karma and webpack under the cover you just need to launch:
  npm test

Webpack is the bundler used here. If you are not familiar with it, you just need to know that a dev web server can 
be launch using "webpack-dev-server" and the application bundle file will be produced using command "webpack"
